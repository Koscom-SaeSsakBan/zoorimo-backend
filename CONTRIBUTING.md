## Code Formatting

Keep your codes clean and consistent using code formatters and linters. Most of the time formatting and linting would already have been set by default in each repository. And sometimes you should use the specific code editor to match the configuration.

## Git commit messages

Generally there are two acceptable styles of commit message.

### commit type: what you did in present-tense, imperative-style

**Available types**

- chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
- docs (changes to documentation)
